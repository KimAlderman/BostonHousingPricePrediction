# BostonHousingPricePrediction

Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree project: predicting Boston housing prices

This was my second project in my Machine Learning Nanodegree at Udacity. Tools and techniques used in this project include:

* data exploration through summary statistics and data visualization
* defining a performance metric (coefficient of determination for this project)
* splitting data into train & test sets, shuffling, and cross-validation
* sklearn and matplotlib libraries for Python
* learning curves & complexity curves to analyze model performance
* bias/variance tradeoff 
* sklearn implementation of a decision-tree model
* use of gridsearch for hyperparameter tuning and optimization
* sensitivity analysis
* real-life applicability
